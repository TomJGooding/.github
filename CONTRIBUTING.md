## Reporting Bugs

Did you find a bug? Bugs are tracked as [GitHub issues](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/).

**Before you create a new bug report, please do a search in open issues to check if the issue has already been reported.**

If you find your issue already exists, post relevant comments and add your [reaction](https://github.com/blog/2119-add-reactions-to-pull-requests-issues-and-comments). Please use a reaction rather than posting a comment consisting solely of "+1" or ":thumbsup:".

If you can't find an existing issue that describes your bug, create a new issue using the relevant issue form. Please include as many details as possible. The more information you can provide, the more likely someone will be successful at reproducing the issue and finding a fix.

## Feature Requests

All feature requests are welcome, whether suggesting completely new features or minor improvements to existing functionality. Feature requests are tracked as [GitHub issues](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/).

**Before you create a new feature request, please do a search in open issues to check if the feature has already been suggested.**

If you find your feature request already exists, post relevant comments and add your [reaction](https://github.com/blog/2119-add-reactions-to-pull-requests-issues-and-comments). Please use a reaction rather than posting a comment consisting solely of "+1" or ":thumbsup:".

If you can't find an existing issue that describes your feature, create a new issue using the relevant issue form. Please include as much detail as possible, including the steps that you imagine you would take if the feature you're requesting existed.
